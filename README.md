# Memory-Card-Game
A Game I've Made using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript

This Game was created as a Group Project for one of my Classes in Fall 2022.
The Game is part of a series of games following a narrative.

One group member created the Graphical Assets for the cards.
Another group member wrote the code for the CSS Transitions and the Sound Effects Code.
Another group member wrote the code for the Score Board/Table.

Originally the core mechanics of the game were based off a tutorial
for a Matching Game, so I worked on reworking the base game to a state
where it would be different enough from the tutorial.
For my work I increased the Max amount of cards within the game,
added a round system(4 cards to start, +2 cards per round to a max of 16 cards),
and reworked the card position randomizer.
